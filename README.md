#NotesCraft

##About the Application
* Notes-Craft is a secure and intuitive web-based note management platform that allows users to create, edit, and delete their own notes. Additionally, 
it enables users to view notes shared by others, offering a collaborative environment while maintaining user control over personal content.
The platform ensures a clean and responsive interface, providing seamless functionality. Data privacy is a top priority, with restrictions on editing and
deleting only the notes created by the logged-in user. Designed to be both scalable and user-friendly, Notes-Craft allows individuals to manage their notes
efficiently for both personal and collaborative use.
